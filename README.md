# Weather-type-classification
<ul>
<li>Extracted insights from data, building visualizations to show statistics and feature importance<\li>
<li>Develop classification models including logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, SVM, random forest, and XGBoost using R<\li>
<li>RBF SVM has the highest score in test data accuracy among all the models (0.837) but is relatively slow considering execution time. <\li>
<li>Random forest and XGBoost had a relatively high accuracy with less time among all models.<\li>
<li>Presented results and insights on a story-telling manner<\li>
